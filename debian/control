Description: load, configure, and compose WSGI applications and servers (Documentation)
 Paste Deployment is a system for finding and configuring WSGI applications and
 servers. For WSGI application consumers it provides a single, simple function
 (loadapp) for loading a WSGI application from a configuration file or a Python
 Egg. For WSGI application providers it only asks for a single, simple entry
 point to your application, so that application users don't need to be exposed
 to the implementation details of your application.
 .
 This package contains the documentation of the library.
